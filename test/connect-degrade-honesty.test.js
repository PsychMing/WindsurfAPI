// WINDSURFAPI_STRICT_MODEL=0 degrades an unmapped model to the free selector. The
// degrade is a deliberate operator opt-out. Reporting the PAID name back as if it ran
// is not — and that is what the response used to do.
//
// Measured before this fix: `claude-opus-4.9` returned 200 with
// `model: "claude-opus-4.9"` on the non-stream body AND on every stream chunk, plus a
// system_fingerprint derived from that name, while `swe-1-6-slow` ran upstream. Wrong
// output, wrong billing attribution, and a client that trusts the echoed name is
// silently misled. #234's acceptance criteria call this out explicitly.
//
// Nothing in the suite asserted the echoed name on this path — verified by instrumenting
// the `mapped === false` branch and running all test files: exactly one test reaches it
// (devin-connect-strict-model.test.js:62) and it only asserts "not a 400". So this file
// is the first coverage of the contract.
//
// The load-bearing subtlety is WHICH name to report. See the router-hop test below.
