// accounts.json so a restart does not undo it.
//
// That exact bug was fixed once for CONTENT_BLOCKED (upstream rejected the prompt)
// and MODEL_BLOCKED (tier wall). UPSTREAM_ERROR was missed: it carries the gRPC
// `internal` class, which classifyUpstreamError itself documents as "PERMANENT
// client mistakes (short fingerprint, gzipped request body) — fails identically
// every retry". The session token is alive and the account is healthy, yet it fell
// through to the generic reportError and got evicted.

// The bug above happened TWICE for the same structural reason: the classification
// ENDED in a bare `else reportError(apiKey)`, so any error code nobody thought
// about was silently treated as an account fault and evicted healthy accounts.
// First STREAM_TRUNCATED landed there, then TIMEOUT / DEADLINE_EXCEEDED / NO_TOKEN.
//
// A behavioural test cannot catch the NEXT one — the code that will land there
// hasn't been written yet. The third recurrence was the TLS/parse families
// (EPROTO / HPE_* / ERR_SSL_*), which Node's own socket layer emits and which no
// enumeration can cover. The fix is structural: the fallthrough is now
// deny-by-default (health-window event, no errorCount), so this guard pins that
// shape instead of trying to enumerate an open-ended vocabulary. It still reads
// both sources to keep the documented code families meaningful.

  //      and the lowercase gRPC statuses. These arrive with `.code` already set
  //      and travel through the connect generator untouched.
  //
  // (b) is why the first version of this guard was blind to the largest class of

  // with an [A-Z_] character class, so ECONNRESET / ETIMEDOUT / EPIPE /
