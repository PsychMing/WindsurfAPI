// Registry guard: every DEFAULT-ON behaviour switch must have an off path someone tested.
//
// WHY
//
// A switch that defaults ON is a behaviour change already shipped to every deploy. Its
// off switch is the only thing standing between "we found a bad shape in production" and
// "roll back the release". #247 shipped as the sole default-on change in a five-PR batch
// with no kill switch at all, and its failure shape was content loss — the switch was
// added afterwards, by the maintainer, not by the PR.
//
// The gap this pins is narrower and more common than "no switch exists": the switch
// exists, and NOTHING EXERCISES IT OFF. Measured when this test was written, of the ten
// default-on switches in src/:
//
//   LS_AUTO_RESTART                              0 tests
//   LS_MEMORY_GUARD                              0 tests
//   RESPONSE_STORE_ENABLED                       0 tests
//   WINDSURFAPI_NLU_RETRY                        0 tests
//   WINDSURFAPI_BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_SKIP_BUSY tests exist, none set it to '0'
//
// An untested off path is a kill switch nobody has ever pulled. It is exactly the shape
// that fails when it is finally needed, at the worst moment, with no way to tell whether
// the switch or the incident broke the deploy.
//
// HOW THIS IS ENFORCED
//
// The list below is a LEDGER, not a discovery mechanism. A new default-on switch fails
// the completeness check until someone adds it here deliberately — the point is that
// shipping one is a decision, not an accident. Each entry is either:
//
//   tested: true   — a test sets it to '0' and asserts the off behaviour
//   waived: '<why>' — deliberately unguarded, with the reason recorded
//
// A waiver is not a free pass: it is a line in a file the next reviewer reads.

  // Every pattern above requires a literal `env.NAME` adjacent to '0' or '1'. Here the
