// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. "The default path emits the same bytes" is this project's
// first invariant — the upstream is a stateful validator, so a stray byte in a
// request frame is a rejected session, not a style question. Until now that
// invariant was only checked by an author-run script living outside the repo, so a
// pull request could change the encoder, pass every test, and be merged.
//
// This test makes the invariant mechanical: it builds complete request frames
// through the current tree and through a PRE-CHANGE tree, over a fixed matrix of
// histories x prepare routes x native/emulated x env switches, and requires the
// bytes to be identical. Any PR that alters default-path output fails here.
//
// The comparison base is the last released tag (CI exports WIRE_BASE_TREE after
// materialising it from scripts/wire-base.mjs, which picks the newest ANNOTATED tag
// that is a strict ancestor of the tested commit — `git describe --tags` returns
// HEAD's own tag on a release commit, and a gate that compares the tree with itself
// passes without testing anything). Locally a `.claude/worktrees/wire-base` checkout
// works. When neither exists the test SKIPS with a reason instead of passing
// quietly — a gate that cannot run must never look green.
//
// The base is IDENTIFIED, not assumed (2026-09-22, D-WIRE-BASE). A directory holding
// the right two filenames is not a released revision, and the recorded re-check of this
// gate passed while its stdout named no revision at all: WIRE_BASE_TREE happened to
// point at v3.9.37, and the stale `.claude/worktrees/wire-base` fallback (0c35545, three
// releases back) was one unset variable away from being the compared tree — the log
// would have reported a byte difference, if any, without ever naming what it compared
// against. So before importing the base modules this file resolves the expected release
// from the tested repository's annotated tags, measures the base checkout's HEAD with
// Git, and refuses to compare unless they match, the base is not the tested commit, and
// the base's src/ tree is clean. The resolved identity is printed as one `WIRE_PROVENANCE`
// line — a comparison whose base cannot be named in the output is not evidence.
//
// An intentional wire change is not allowed to weaken the comparison. It must name itself in
// test/wire-expected-diffs.json: one entry per differing comparison, carrying the issue, the
// declared message order before/after, the byte length, and a verifier (test/wire-expected-diffs.js)
// that requires every byte outside the repeated message field to be identical and every message
// payload to survive modulo its per-message uuid. A diff with no entry fails; an entry that
// matches no diff fails as stale; an entry that matches more than one fails as ambiguous.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE (2026-09-17 review, protocol lens — do not read this
// gate as "the wire is correct"):
//   • it compares the protobuf request body only; not HTTP/Connect framing, not the
//     handler, not the response stream;
//   • the matrix is 9 histories x 5 prepare routes x native/emulated x 3 env, chosen
//     around the shapes that changed recently — it does NOT contain #271's
//     split-call + stray-text shape, and every replay env here is default or
//     explicitly off, so reasoning-replay behaviour is out of scope;
//   • a pre-existing defect that survives both trees passes by construction: dropping
//     image-only assistant turns (#272) is byte-identical before and after any of
//     these commits.
// It proves exactly one thing, and it is the thing it must prove: the default path
// did not move.
