// of ~2333 added lines in a typical round, ~1100 were never scanned — and a real key
// pasted into a fixture is exactly as leaked as one in src/. So test/ IS scanned now.
//
// What made the blanket skip tempting is that fixtures legitimately contain key-SHAPED
// strings (8 in the tree when this changed, all of the `sk-ws-01-fixturekey…` /
// `sk-1234567890…` form). Those are allow-listed below by SHAPE, not by path: a fixture
// must look obviously synthetic to pass. A random-looking 20-char secret in a test file
// still fails the scan, which is the point.

// scans clean under the current rules (verified 2026-10-23, exit 0), so there was no
// measured reason to keep exempting it — and a real token pasted into a captured
// response is exactly the leak this scanner exists to catch. Shape markers are the only
// allowance a test file gets.
//
// SCOPE: this scans the WORKING TREE (`git ls-files -co`, plus explicit paths). A

// scanning (`git log -p` / gitleaks / GitHub secret scanning) is a SEPARATE job and is
