// `test/` was skipped wholesale until 2026-08. Audit round 10 measured the cost:
// of ~2333 added lines in a typical round, ~1100 were never scanned — and a real key
// pasted into a fixture is exactly as leaked as one in src/. So test/ IS scanned now.
//
// What made the blanket skip tempting is that fixtures legitimately contain key-SHAPED
// strings (8 in the tree when this changed, all of the `sk-ws-01-fixturekey…` /
// `sk-1234567890…` form). Those are allow-listed by SHAPE in scripts/secret-rules.mjs,
// not by path: a fixture
// must look obviously synthetic to pass. A random-looking 20-char secret in a test file
// still fails the scan, which is the point.
//
// `test/_research/` was the last path-based hole. It is four wire-capture fixtures and
// scans clean under the current rules (verified 2026-10-23, exit 0), so there was no
// measured reason to keep exempting it — and a real token pasted into a captured
// response is exactly the leak this scanner exists to catch. Shape markers are the only
// allowance a test file gets.
//
// SCOPE: this scans the WORKING TREE (`git ls-files -co`, plus explicit paths). A
// credential that was committed and later deleted is invisible here — that is
// `scripts/history-secret-scan.mjs`, which scans every blob in the repository's history
// with the SAME rules (scripts/secret-rules.mjs) and runs in the `history-secrets` CI job.
// Both scopes are needed: this one sees the files an operator has now, the other sees the
// ones that were deleted after being leaked.
