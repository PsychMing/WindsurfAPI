/**
 * Responses API server-side conversation state.
 *
 * WHY: `/v1/responses` advertises OpenAI Responses compatibility, whose defining
 * feature is that the SERVER holds the conversation. A client sends only the new
 * turn plus `previous_response_id` and the server prepends everything before it.
 *
 * Before this module `previous_response_id` was never read (grep: zero hits in
 * handlers/responses.js). A chained client therefore reached the upstream with a
 * SINGLE message every turn — the model answered each turn blind, with no error
 * and no warning, producing fluent but context-free replies the caller had no way
 * to diagnose. That silent-wrong-answer mode is the thing this fixes.
 *
 * Design:
 *   - Each stored entry holds the FULL accumulated message list for that turn
 *     (input + the assistant output), not a parent pointer. Resolution is then a
 *     single O(1) lookup instead of walking a chain, and a mid-chain eviction
 *     cannot silently truncate history — the lookup either has everything or
 *     fails loudly.
 *   - Entries are scoped by callerKey. A response id minted for one caller MUST
 *     NOT resolve for another, or tenant A could read tenant B's conversation by
 *     replaying an id. Lookup mismatch fails closed (treated as not found).
 *   - Bounded like every other in-memory table here: TTL, a hard cap, LRU
 *     eviction with a per-tenant fair share so one caller cannot flush everyone
 *     else's conversations (same lesson as account/sticky-session.js).
 *   - `store: false` on the request skips persistence, per the OpenAI contract —
 *     such a response cannot later be used as a `previous_response_id`. The value
 *     is NORMALIZED here rather than trusted as a boolean; see wantsPersistence.
 *
 * Configure via env:
 *   RESPONSE_STORE_ENABLED=0        — disable (default: on)
 *   RESPONSE_STORE_TTL_MS=3600000   — IDLE timeout in ms (default: 1 hour)
 *   RESPONSE_STORE_MAX_AGE_MS=86400000 — absolute retention bound (default: 24 hours)
 *   RESPONSE_STORE_MAX=2000         — max stored responses (default: 2000)
 *   RESPONSE_STORE_MAX_MESSAGES=400 — per-conversation message cap (default: 400)
 *   RESPONSE_STORE_MAX_BYTES=128m   — total byte budget (default: 128MB; b/k/kb/m/mb/g/gb)

// alive forever (measured at RESPONSE_STORE_TTL_MS=120: polled every 40ms for
// 1020ms, i.e. 8.5x the TTL, 25 successful reads, entry still alive). No floor

// recover from. Note the bound is per response id and createdAt survives a
// same-id refresh, so a real chain is unaffected either way — every turn mints a

/**
 * Does this `store` value ask for persistence?
 *
 * The check used to be `opts.store === false` — strict, on a value that arrives
 * RAW off the request body (handlers/responses.js passes `store: body.store` with
 * no normalization). So only a real JSON `false` opted out. MEASURED against HEAD:
 *   store=false  -> not stored (correct)
 *   store="false" / 0 / "no" / "off" / null / ""  -> ALL stored and retrievable
 * A client that spells the flag as a string — form-encoded relays, shell wrappers
 * and hand-rolled clients all do — got retention it explicitly opted out of, and
 * had no way to tell.
 *
 * WHERE this belongs: here, not only at the HTTP boundary. The retention decision
 * is the store's own contract ("`store:false` means this response is not
 * retained"), and the store is what would have to be audited if the promise were
 * broken. A boundary-only fix leaves the strict comparison in place for every
 * other caller, present and future, and this call site was added by exactly that
 * kind of later wiring. The boundary is still where a MALFORMED request should be
 * rejected outright; normalizing here means the store never over-retains even when
 * it is not.
 *
 * `undefined` means the field was absent, and the OpenAI default is store=true —
 * so absent must NOT read as opted out. An explicit `null` does: it is a value the
 * client chose to send, and for a retention decision the safe reading of an
 * ambiguous explicit value is "do not retain" (the cost is a 404 on a later chain
 * attempt, which is diagnosable; the cost of the other reading is silent retention
 * of data the caller may believe was never kept). An unrecognized token
 * ("maybe", {}) is not an opt-out signal and keeps the documented default.

  // storing a large conversation flushed every other tenant's sessions.
  // Reproduced: 5 tenants x 5 conversations all readable, then a single 5MB write
  // evicted 25/25 of them. That is a cross-tenant DoS the count-only store never
  // had, so fairness here compares the tenant's BYTES against MAX_BYTES/tenants.
  //

  // Map-tail argument only holds for the untenanted scan. oldestId(tenant) can

  // path.

  // The share has a FLOOR. `MAX_BYTES / tenants` alone collapses as tenants grow:
  // at 600 tenants against the 2MB test budget the share is ~3.5KB, so every
  // tenant is over share, every iteration evicts the writer's own oldest, and once
  // the writer has nothing left of its own the loop breaks — with the budget still
  // blown. Reproduced: 600 tenants x one 20KB conversation → 5.88x the budget and
  // ZERO evictions, i.e. the byte bound stopped existing at exactly the scale it
  // was written to protect. The floor keeps eviction working past that point: a
  // tenant under MIN_TENANT_BYTES is treated as a small fry and the global LRU scan
  // reclaims from whoever is actually oldest, which is the only thing that can
  // bring a many-small-tenants total back under budget.
