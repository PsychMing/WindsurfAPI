/**
 * Atomic JSON file writer.
 *
 * The naive `writeFileSync(path, JSON.stringify(...))` truncates the
 * target file and then writes — if the process gets killed (SIGTERM
 * during docker stop, SIGKILL on OOM, panic-style crash) between the
 * truncate and the final write, the file is left empty or partial.
 * Next start, JSON.parse fails, the load() handler logs a warning and
 * silently falls back to defaults — user loses every persisted
 * setting, model-access list, proxy config, etc.
 *
 * Pattern: write the new contents to a unique sibling `${target}.*.tmp` first,
 * fsync(2) the tmp so the bytes actually reach disk, then `rename(2)` it onto
 * the target. rename is atomic on POSIX and replaces an existing target on
 * Windows (per Node's documented fs.renameSync behavior). A crash between the
 * durable tmp write and renameSync leaves the target intact; a crash after
 * renameSync leaves the (already-fsynced) new contents in place. Either way,
 * no truncated JSON and no rename-published-but-never-flushed tmp inode.
 *
 * Tmp file gets unlinked on write failure so repeated failures don't
 * leak garbage in DATA_DIR.
 *
 * Used by every dashboard config persister: model-access.json,
 * proxy.json, stats.json, runtime-config.json. accounts.json already
 * uses the same pattern hand-rolled in src/auth.js (kept inline there
 * because it has its own coalescing/_saveInFlight machinery).

// ── Windows ACL hardening ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `mode: 0o600` is a POSIX contract; on Windows Node maps it (at best) to the
// read-only bit and the file keeps the ACL it inherits from its directory —
// `BUILTIN\Users:(RX)` and `NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(M)` on a default
// profile. accounts.json holds upstream tokens in cleartext and the packaged
// first-run .env holds the API key + dashboard password, so "owner-only" has to
// be enforced explicitly there.
//
// Best effort by design: a failed icacls must never fail the write that just
// succeeded (the bytes are already durable), but it must be LOUD — a silent
// failure is the same inherited-ACE exposure with a false sense of safety.
// `/inheritance:r` drops inherited ACEs (which is what Users/Authenticated
// Users get); `/grant:r <user>:(F)` leaves exactly one explicit owner ACE.
// Group names are deliberately not referenced — they are localized, while
// `/inheritance:r` works on every Windows locale.
